A ruby on rails website made by Ankur Singh.
It has a user auth with a hidden is_admin key to define admins(needed to be changed in db to give admin privelages).
A user can see a listing of the jobs and apply to them. The admin can CRUD jobs and is able to see which user has applied to which job on his homepage. Uses postgresql and also tested with mysql.

Pending work:- Creating a mailer, creating user profiles and linking it to admin feed's link.
