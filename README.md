A ruby on rails website made by Ankur Singh.
It has a user auth with a hidden is_admin key to define admins(needed to be changed in db to give admin privelages).
A user can see a listing of the jobs and apply to them. The admin can CRUD jobs and is able to see which user has applied to which job on his homepage. Uses postgresql and also tested with mysql.

EDIT: NO MORE: Intregrated with codeship and heroku for continous deployment at ror1test.herokuapp.com

Pending work:- Mailer, handle new admins, handle deleted jobs/projects, authenticate users with ep id and confirmation email,improve frontend.
